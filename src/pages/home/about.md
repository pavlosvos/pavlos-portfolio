I excel at being an Agile UX Consultant, mentor, and coach in Web & Mobile development projects.

Having worked as a hybrid designer and developer, I am uniquely qualified to bridge both roles and lead multi-discipline teams to the successful creation of even the most challenging projects.

My international career has given me the opportunity to lead UX/UI teams on a broad spectrum of mission-critical projects for clients that include Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit, Allianz, EON, and The Abu Dhabi Executive Office and Givaudan in Kemptthal and Paris.

In my career, I have worked for start-ups, mature internet companies, and consulting firms; giving me a qualified perspective on different aspects of the business. I am a strong proponent for Agile UX methodologies and the efficiency benefits they bring to projects and organizations.
